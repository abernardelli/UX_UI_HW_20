        <h1>Anthony Bernardelli</h1>
        <p>UX/UI Designer with three years of experience as a public relations contractor for the US military. I graduate from the UTSA UX/UI Design Bootcamp in August 2022. My experience in PR taught me how to lead small groups and how to be an effective member of larger efforts. My experience in the UTSA Bootcamp taught me how to use tools such as Figma and Miro; it also trained me in processes like usability testing and wireframing. I have a creative mind that loves to focus on computer work and technical tasks.</p>

        <h3>Technical Design</h3>
        <p>One of my favorite things to do is sit down with a project that needs to be designed in Figma, Photoshop, or Invision. Iâ€™m learning to use Visual Studio and GitHub to program websites too; this skill is currently in training.</p>

        <h3>User Interface Design</h3>
        <p>I use my experience in UI design to bring together visuals, interaction, and information into one product. I am responsible for deducing what users want and what they will do on projects such as an app or website. I strive to find new ways to design new ideas.</p>

        <h3>Iterative Prototyping</h3>
        <p>During the UX/UI Bootcamp, I became very familiar with using Figma to create interactive prototypes of the different ideas myself and others came up with. I am able to create initial prototypes based on wireframes; I'm also able to modify a project based on user feedback and staff input.</p>

          <h4>Texas Reptile and Small Animal Rescue</h4>
          <p>For this project, I worked on a desktop and mobile website redesign. I wore the hats of a copywriter, an editor, and a researcher most often in terms of submitting deliverables. My focus was on delivering a website to the client that would gain approval, so when our team looked at the original website, we made choices based on that view. We wanted the client to want the website, not just like it. We drew inspiration from the original design to cater to that.</p>

          <h4>BlooKat</h4>
          <p>A story and song learning experience for language development, the BlooKat app was a challenge to build because it catered to two target audiences at the same time: doting parents and curious toddlers. My team and I designed the app to try to solve for lack of interest in language development among young children and discovered interested parents right from the beginning!</p>
